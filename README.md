# 10B17CI672 Compiler Design Lab

## Objective:  
The lab course provides the complete description about inner working of a compiler. The main focus is on the design of compilers and optimization techniques. The course also aims to convey the language specifications, use of regular expressions and context free grammars behind the design of compiler. It builds an understandability of various parsing techniques like predictive parsing, LR parsing, LALR parsing. It also focuses on the design of Compiler writing tools.

## Learning Outcome:
1.	Gain an in-depth understanding of the principles underlying the design and construction of compilers.
2.	Functioning of Compiler writing tools.
3.	Building various parsing techniques
